# phplist-plugin-embedremoteimages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michield/phplist-plugin-embedremoteimages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michield/phplist-plugin-embedremoteimages)

This plugin will add a choice "HTML, with remote images embedded" to the Format tab of a campaign.

phpList already has this functionality, by setting the configuration ["EMBEDEXTERNALIMAGES"](https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/embedexternalimages) to true, but this plugin allows setting that per campaign, as opposed to system wide.
